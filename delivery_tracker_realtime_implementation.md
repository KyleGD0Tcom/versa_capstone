## How It Works

### Delivery Completion Flow

2. **Backend**: Updates delivery status and creates notification for warehouse
3. **Frontend**: Shows success notification and closes modal
4. **Warehouse Department**: Receives notification within 3 seconds automatically
5. **Real-Time Updates**: Both departments see changes without page refreshes

### Notification Flow
1. **Delivery Status Update**: When delivery is marked as "Delivered"
2. **Notification Creation**: System creates notification for warehouse department
3. **Real-Time Polling**: Warehouse department polls every 3 seconds
4. **Immediate Display**: Notification appears in warehouse notification dropdown
5. **User Action**: Warehouse user can click notification to view details

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Real-Time Notifications
1. Open warehouse department in one browser tab
2. Open delivery tracker in another tab
3. Mark a delivery as "Delivered"
4. Watch warehouse notification appear within 3 seconds
5. Verify no page refresh is needed

### Test 2: Delivery Tracker Updates
1. Open delivery tracker page
2. Mark a delivery as "In-Transit" or "Delivered"
3. Verify success notification appears
4. Verify modal closes automatically
5. Verify page updates show new status

## Performance Considerations
