### 3. Search and Filter
- **Real-Time Search**: Search by request ID, invoice number, client name, or unit name
- **Status Filter**: Filter by Pending, Processing, or Completed status

- **Visual Indicators**: Unread notifications have blue left border
- **Auto-Dismiss**: Notifications auto-remove after 5 seconds
- **Click to Navigate**: Click notifications to go to relevant pages

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic Real-Time Updates
1. Open delivery requests page in browser
2. Open warehouse invoice page in another tab
3. Send an invoice to delivery from warehouse
4. Watch delivery requests page update automatically (within 3 seconds)
5. Verify new request appears without page refresh

### Test 2: Search Functionality
1. On delivery requests page, type in search box
2. Verify results filter in real-time
3. Test searching by:
   - Request ID (e.g., "DVR-2025-0001")
   - Invoice number (e.g., "INVWH-20250101-0001")
   - Client name
   - Unit name

### Test 3: Status Filtering
1. Use the status dropdown to filter by:
   - Pending
   - Processing
   - Completed
2. Verify only matching requests are shown

### Test 4: Notification System
1. Send a new delivery request from warehouse
2. Verify notification appears in delivery department
3. Click notification to navigate to the request
4. Verify notification disappears after 5 seconds

### Test 5: Visual Indicators
1. Watch for the spinner indicator when updates are being fetched
2. Verify "Real-time updates" text is visible
3. Check that notifications have proper styling

## Technical Details

### AJAX Endpoints
- `GET /delivery/requests/feed/` - Returns JSON of delivery requests
- `GET /notifications/feed/` - Returns JSON of notifications
- `POST /warehouse/api/send-to-delivery/` - Creates new delivery request

### JavaScript Features
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with console logging
- **Performance**: Only updates DOM when data changes
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and timeouts
- **Cross-Browser**: Uses standard fetch API with fallbacks

### Database Updates
- Delivery requests are created in real-time
- Notifications are generated automatically
- Status updates are reflected immediately

## Troubleshooting

### If Real-Time Updates Don't Work
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify network requests in browser dev tools
3. Ensure server is running and accessible
4. Check that CSRF tokens are properly set

### If Search/Filter Don't Work
1. Verify JavaScript is enabled
2. Check for console errors
3. Ensure input elements have correct IDs

### If Notifications Don't Appear
1. Check notification dropdown is included in template
2. Verify user has proper department permissions
3. Check notification feed endpoint is accessible

## Performance Considerations
- Polling interval is optimized for responsiveness vs. server load
- DOM updates are minimized to only when necessary
- Memory leaks are prevented with proper cleanup
- Network requests include proper error handling
